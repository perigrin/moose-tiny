=head1 NAME

Moose::Tiny - Why Should Object::Tiny get all the Fun


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Moose::Tiny version 0.0.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Define a class
    package Foo;

    use Moose::Tiny qw{ bar baz };

    1;


    # Use the class
    my $object = Foo->new( bar => 1 );

    print "bar is " . $object->bar . "\n";
  

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I was looking at Object::Tiny and thought, wow I bet I could do that really easily with Moose. I was right.

=head1 INTERFACE 

None. Moose::Tiny currently exports what Moose itself exports. Simply call it with a list of attribute names and it will create 
read only accessors for you.

    use Moose::Tiny qw(foo bar);
    
or a larger list

    use Moose::Tiny qw(
        item_font_face
        item_font_color
        item_font_size
        item_text_content
        item_display_time
        seperator_font_face
        seperator_font_color
        seperator_font_size
        seperator_text_content
    )

This will create a bunch of simple accessors, and set the inheritance to be the child of Moose::Object, just like if you'd created them with Moose itself.
It will also make your class immutable for performance reasons (and because if you're using this you probably don't care).

=head1 WHY?

Well I was looking at Object::Tiny's docs and realized that Moose wasn't even in the argument. I felt bad. So I decided hey I could make this work.

Object::Tiny has a bunch of statistics to show why it is better than Class::Accessor::Fast. Here are some statistics of our own.

=over

=item Moose::Tiny is 8% shorter to type than Object::Tiny

That's right, Moose is one less letter than Object, and since otherwise the APIs are identical that's an 8% savings overall.

=item Moose::Tiny brings you the full power of Moose

If you buy now you get C<with>, C<around>, C<after>, C<before> and several other goodies as well! Call now operators are standing by.

=back

Really that's all I got. Since you get all the Moose metaobject goodness our memory footprint is probably a fair bit larger ... but hey 8% savings when you're typing the code out!

=head1 CAVEATS

Moose works differently from Object::Tiny. Most importantly moose won't auto-vivify attribute slots, so if you don't define it in the command line it won't exist in the instance data structure, even if you pass a value to new(); Object::Tiny doesn't document this behavior but it is tested.

Also attribute slots in Moose are always created even if they're undefined. This behavior *may* change in the future, it's undocumented in Moose, but Object::Tiny expect that if you haven't populated an attribute, that attribute doesn't exist in the instance data structure. This is also not really documented, but is tested for.

Alias has reported some more caveats:

=head2 Installation 

    Moose::Tiny has a number of recursive dependencies (and a few more build_requires deps not shown) with non-perfect cpan testers results (72% aggregate  
    success installing).

Mooe::Tiny has all of the build requirements of Moose itself. Be prepared to install everything listed in http://cpandeps.cantrell.org.uk/?module=Moose%3A%3ATiny

=head2 Memory 

    Moose::Tiny uses 4.5 megabytes of memory. This is around 550 times larger than Object::Tiny, or a more impressive sounding 55,000% larger :)

=head2 Startup 

    Moose::Tiny takes around a second to load up on the virtual I'm currently working in. Granted that's also in the debugger, so it's WAY slower than it could 
    be, but Object::Tiny does not take any noticable time to load, even in the same scenario.

This is also an overhead cost from Moose. Neither have been reccomended for use in a critical situation where you are constantly restarting the perl process (eg. CGI). If you find yourself in this situation either try to use a persistant environment (pperl, mod_perl, fastcgi) or try Object::Tiny. On the plus side, our API is 100% compatible so you can switch bak and forth easily.
